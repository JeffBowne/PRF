				<h1>Prospective Volunteers</h1>
				<p>
					We are always looking for kind, compassionate individuals to do volunteer work for ferrets  who are currently in danger and in need of loving arms.
					At PRF , our volunteers play an important role in the overall success of our organization. They assist ferrets, their offsprings, and visitors to our facilities and are valued members of the rescue team.
				</p>
				<h1>How can I help?</h1>
				<p>
					The rapid disappearance of ferrets in recent decades is undoubtedly the most tragic loss of biodiversity we have ever witnessed, and is one of the most serious environmental issues of our time. Fixing a problem of this magnitude requires a collaborative effort on the part of scientists, politicians, educators, businesses, and members of the media, as well as high-profile personalities such as actors and musicians, who can quickly influence public opinion and bring an obscure issue to the forefront of public consciousness. It also requires a concerted effort on the part of average citizens, all of whom have the ability to reduce their impact on the environment, and exert their influence on elected officials and the businesses they choose to support.
				</p>
				<h1>How do I get started?</h1>
				<p>
					You can get started by calling us on: <strong>1-800-FER-RETS</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>OR</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					By sending an email to: volunteer@prf-ferrets.org
